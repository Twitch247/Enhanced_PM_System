[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod makes some changes to the PM system, seperating the PM conversations from the PM list.  It adds an Outbox to the mix and seperates unread PMs from those that have been read.  It changes the "labels" into "folders" and removes the contents of the PM from the email notification.  It will allow users to edit PMs that they have sent out, as long as NO RECIPIENT has read it.  It also allows users to unsend any unread PMs to other users.

This mod adds settings in the "Features and Options" page.  By default, this mod forces the view for personal messages to Conversation mode, but there is a new switch permitting the users to select a different mode other than Conversation mode.  The "PM Remove Inbox Label" and "Copy to Outbox" options are removed from the Personal Messages Settings page and set as default.

As a anti-spam measure, this mod can block new members from sending PMs during the 24-hour period after their account is activated.  Please note that members activated before this mod is installed will not be affected by this anti-spam measure, as the activation time is not recorded in the database prior to this mod.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Known Compatibility Notes & Issues[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.4, and may work on SMF 2.0 and later.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported!

The [url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=1974]PM Attachments[/url] mod should be installed first to avoid any conflict with this mod.

At present time, it is not possible to list and/or remove files attached to the PM while editing the PM.  Future versions of this mod should provide this support.
