# ENHANCED PM SYSTEM v3.5.2

[**By Dougiefresh**](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=253913) - [Link to Mod](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=3736)

# Introduction
This mod makes some changes to the PM system, seperating the PM conversations from the PM list.  It forces all users to conversation mode and makes users click on the message they want to view.  This keeps the forum from marking the latest message as read if you glance over the message list and click on something else and want to read a message that isn't the latest message received.

It adds an Outbox to the mix and seperates unread PMs from those that have been read.  It changes the "labels" into "folders" and removes the contents of the PM from the email notification.  It will allow users to edit PMs that they have sent out, as long as NO RECIPIENT has read it.  It also allows users to unsend and delete any unread PMs to other users.

This mod adds settings in the "Features and Options" page.  By default, this mod forces the view for personal messages to Conversation mode, but there is a new switch permitting the users to select a different mode other than Conversation mode.  The "PM Remove Inbox Label" and "Copy to Outbox" options are removed from the Personal Messages Settings page and set as default.

Version 2.0 sports an enhanced PM search system, which allows you to search Sent Items and the Outbox for PMs you specify.  It also allows the user to search them by username, just like the core functionality provided for the Inbox.  You are allowed to move PMs to folders for Inbox PMs, and allowed to delete PMs from all folders.

Version 3.0 adds the PM Quick Reply box, as well as changes some options to membergroup permissions....

As a anti-spam measure, this mod can block new members from sending PMs during the 24-hour period after their account is activated.  Please note that members activated before this mod is installed will not be affected by this anti-spam measure, as the activation time is not recorded in the database prior to this mod.

## Compatibility Notes
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.9, but should work on SMF 2.1 Beta 2, as well as SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.

The [PM Attachments](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=1974) mod should be installed first to avoid any conflict with this mod.

## Questions and Answers
**Q:** Will this mod ever include PM attachment support?

**A:** No, there is a [PM Attachments](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=1974) mod already developed that supports this.  The exception is editing PMs with attachments, which this mod will eventually support fully.

**Q:** Why can't I edit the attachments on a PM?

**A:** At present time, it is not possible to list and/or remove files attached to the PM while editing the PM.  Future versions of this mod will resolve this issue.

**Q:** Why can't I move messages from the Outbox and/or Sent Items folder?

**A:** At present time, it is not possible to mass-move messages from the Outbox or Sent Items folder.  Future versions of this mod may resolve this issue.
